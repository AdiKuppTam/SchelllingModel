Your neighbors probably look like you. How do I know that? Prof. Thomas Schelling already predicted it in 1978.

# Adout The Model

Schelling segregation module by Prof. Thomas Schelling suggests a mathematical explanation for segregation among urban population. 
This research was conducted to find out why cities tend to gather in segregated areas, even though we know nowadays the importance of diversity. 

For an hypothetical example, lets talk about a green triangle that lives happily in The Shape City. Perhaps there is some neighbors that doesn't look like him, but that's OK - as long as at least â…“ of his neighbors are green triangles. If this balance is violated, he might feel like a black sheep (or may I say, shape). Then, he might consider moving out.

That's the base of idea behind Schelling model. The model simulation begins with a randomally scattered population, mixed shape-wise. In every model iteration, an unsatisfied shape will move to a random available spot in the city. The model stops running when all the neighbors are happy with their environment.

# Insights & Conclusions

The model shows that even if the shapes in The Shape City are a little "shapist", they will reach to a segregated city in no-time. Moreover then that, even a small bias will lead to a severe segregation.

Fortunately, the model also have some good news. It turns out that even little diversity preference can turn the table. If the green triangle is unsatisfied if he doesn't have at least 10% of neighbors that are different from him, the segregation occur slower, if at all. Moreover, the segregation is much less radical then without diversity preference. This factor was much more dominant than the "shapisem" variable, in terms of segregation level and pace.

We have to be careful when trying to conclude applicable insight for the real world. We have to take into consideration more parameters that effect segregation in real-life - such as socioeconomic and resources gap between different regions of the city. Along with that, a standard populated area won't have a randomly scattered population, but already segregated in some level.
